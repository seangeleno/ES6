# ES6 and the V8 Engine
The V8 Engine is swiftly approaching spec-compliance, and Node ships with a good selection of ES2015 features ready for production. It's this latter list of features that I consider the Essentialsâ„¢, as it represents the set of feature we can use without a transpiler like Babel or Traceur.

1. Block Scoping with let and const
2. Arrow Functions
3. Shorthand properties and methods
